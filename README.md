## Binary Trees Project
### Overview

This collaborative project focuses on the implementation of basic binary tree operations in the C programming language. The tasks involve creating, inserting nodes, deleting the entire tree, and traversing the tree using pre-order, in-order, and post-order methods. The project aims to deepen understanding of binary trees, their properties, and associated algorithms.

### Learning Objectives

Upon completion of this project, team members are expected to:

    Understand the concept of a binary tree.
    Differentiate between a binary tree and a Binary Search Tree.
    Recognize the potential gain in time complexity compared to linked lists.
    Define the depth, height, and size of a binary tree.
    Implement different traversal methods to navigate a binary tree.
    Describe a complete, full, perfect, and balanced binary tree.
